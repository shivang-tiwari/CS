\section{Defining Stability}
We define an algorithm $A:\mathcal{S}\to\mathbb{R}^d$ to be stable if
\[\|A(S)-A(S')\| = \mathcal{O}\left(\dfrac{1}{|S|}\right)\]
The condition for this stability is for sets $S$ and $S'$ such that they differ only in element hence $S' = e'\cup(S\backslash e)$ where $e\neq e'$.\\
\[\|A(S)-A(S\backslash e)\| = \mathcal{O}\left(\dfrac{1}{|S|}\right)\]
We want to see that whether it is true that changing one element from the set changes its stability or not.

\begin{proof}
We see that $\|A(S)-A(S\backslash e)\| = \mathcal{O}(1/|S|)$ and $\|A(S')-A(S'\backslash e')\| = \mathcal{O}(1/|S'|)$.
\begin{align*}
    \|A(S) - A(S')\| &\leq \|A(S)-A(S\backslash e)\| + \|A(S'\backslash e') - A(S')\|\\
    &= \mathcal{O}(1/|S|) + \mathcal{O}(1/|S'|)\\
    &= \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{|S|}\right)
\end{align*}
Hence the statement is true.
\end{proof}

\section{Applying stability to classification}
Let us say we have a dataset $D = \{(x_i,y_i)\}$. Let us say we have some convex loss function $l(w^Tx,y)$ which is Lipschitz continuous. Let us define the following function over $S \subset D$ which has regularization
\[F_w(S) = \sum_S (l(w^Tx_i,y_i) + \lambda\|w\|^2)\]
Using this function we can define the following vector which minimizes the sum of the loss as
\[w^*(S) = \text{argmin}_wF_w(S)\]
\begin{proposition}
For the defined $F_w(S)$ with a convex and Lipschitz $l(w^Tx,y)$, $w^*$ is stable.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let us define the notation $l(w^*(S),e) = l(w^*(S)^Tx,y)$. Now we take a close look at the value $F_{w^*(S')}(S) - F_{w^*(S)}(S)$. We must have the following hold
\[F_{w^*(S')}(S) - F_{w^*(S)}(S) = F_{w^*(S')}(S') - F_{w^*(S)}(S') + l(w^*(S'),e) - l(w^*(S),e) + l(w^*(S),e') - l(w^*(S'),e')\]
Since $w^*(S') = \text{argmin}_wF_w(S')$ we have $F_{w^*(S')}(S') - F_{w^*(S)}(S') \leq 0$ hence
\[F_{w^*(S')}(S) - F_{w^*(S)}(S) \leq l(w^*(S'),e) - l(w^*(S),e) + l(w^*(S),e') - l(w^*(S'),e') \leq 2L\|w^*(S)-w^*(S')\|\]
The last part of the inequality comes by combining the triangle inequality with the Lipschitz condition of $ l(w^*(S'),e) - l(w^*(S),e) \leq L\|w^*(S)-w^*(S')\|$.\\
We can also expand $F_{w^*(S')}(S) - F_{w^*(S)}(S)$ as a taylor expansion about the point $w^*(S)$.
\[F_{w^*(S')}(S) - F_{w^*(S)}(S) = \frac{\partial F_w(S)}{\partial w}\bigg|_{w = w^*(S)}(w - w^*(S)) + \frac{1}{2}(w-w^*(S))^TH(w-w^*(S)) + \dots\]
Here $H(F_w(S))$ is the Hessian for the function $F_w(S)$ with respect to $w$. We know that $w^*(S)$ minimizes $F_w(S)$ hence the first term vanishes and we are left with the inequality
\[F_{w^*(S')}(S) - F_{w^*(S)}(S) \geq \frac{1}{2}(w^*(S')-w^*(S))^TH(F_{w^*(S')}(S))(w^*(S')-w^*(S))\]
We know that $l(w,e)$ is a convex function hence the Hessian $H(l(w,e))$ is positive semi-definite. Hence we can surely conclude that the Hessian of the sum of all $l(w,e)$ terms is also positive semi-definite.\\
Now we can look at the regularization term, this will have to add a $2\lambda|S|I$ to the Hessian by definition and so we can conclude that $H(F_w(S)) \geq 2\lambda|S|I$ since the loss terms Hessian will anyways be positive semi-definite. Hence we have
\[F_{w^*(S')}(S) - F_{w^*(S)}(S) \geq \frac{2\lambda|S|}{2}(w^*(S')-w^*(S))^T(w^*(S')-w^*(S)) \geq \lambda|S|\|w^*(S')-w^*(S)\|^2\]
By combining the two inequalities we obtain by using first the Lipschitz condition and then that of convexity we obtain
\[\lambda|S|\|w^*(S')-w^*(S)\|^2 \leq F_{w^*(S')}(S) - F_{w^*(S)}(S) \leq 2L\|w^*(S)-w^*(S')\|\]
This subsequently reduces to 
\[\|w^*(S')-w^*(S)\| \leq \frac{2L}{\lambda|S|} = \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{|S|}\right)\]
Hence we have proven that with a convex and Lipschitz $l(w^Tx,y)$, $w^*$ is stable.
